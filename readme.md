## Abstract 
A fundamental challenge for machine learning models is how to generalize learned models for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Among various approaches, exploiting invariant features by Domain Adversarial Training (DAT) received widespread attention. Despite its success, we observe training instability from DAT, mostly due to over-confident domain discriminator and environment label noise. To address this issue, we proposed Environment Label Smoothing (ELS), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels. By incorporating ELS with DAT methods, we are able to yield state-of-art results on a wide range of domain generalization/adaptation tasks, particularly when the environment labels are highly noisy.

### Dependencies
Dependencies of different settings are listed in each subfolder and are from different existing GitHub projects. Compared to all original projects, we add additional hyper-parameters such as 
```
parser.add_argument('--label_smooth', action='store_true',
        help='domain label smmoth')
parser.add_argument('--eps', type=float, default=0.1,
         help='eps for domain label smmoth')
```
You can use the arguments to control whether use environment label smoothing for domain adversarial methods flexibly.
