WOODS is a project aimed at investigating the implications of Out-of-Distribution generalization problems in sequential data along with itâ€™s possible solution. To that goal, we offer a DomainBed-like suite to test domain generalization algorithms on our WILDS-like set of sequential data benchmarks inspired from real world problems of a wide array of common modalities in modern machine learning.
